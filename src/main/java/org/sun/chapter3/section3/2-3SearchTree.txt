Definition:
A 2-3 search tree is a tree that is either empty or
- A 2-node, with one key (and associated value) and two links, a left link to a 2-3 search tree with smaller keys, and a
right link to a 2-3 search tree with larger keys.
- A 3-node, with two keys(and associated value) and three links, a left link to a 2-3 search tree with smaller keys, a
middle link to a 2-3 search tree with keys between the node's keys and a right link to a 2-3 search tree with larger keys.

As usual, we refer to a link to an empty tree as a null link.

A perfectly balanced 2-3 search tree is one whose null links are all the same distance from the root.
